Committee heads will be decided jointly by both the collaborating club and HOPE. Please message a HOPE exec if
you have any questions.
Answer the following questions as honestly as possible. Please limit your responses to less
than 100 words.
1. Why do you want to be a committee head for the committee(s) you selected?
When I first came to TAMS, I was overwhelmed by the amount of volunteer
opportunities HOPE had, so I participated in the first committee I saw, Global Virtual
School. However, I quickly realized that GVS was more than a way for me to receive
volunteer hours, it was an opportunity that has allowed me to impact people across the
world. Teaching English to Pakistani and Afghani adults, I have seen first hand what
education can provide to the most overlooked in society. Hence, I want to lead GVS and
promote its mission of equipping all people with valuable skills.
2. Why do you feel you are qualified to lead the committee(s)?
Over the past year, I have served GVS in various capacities. Last semester, I was a
teacher for the Hyderabad class, where I led classes every week and became well versed
in the curriculum provided by the Worldwide Education Fund. Additionally, I had the
unique opportunity to be both a teacher and a grader this semester, where I have given
feedback on students’ assignments and worked with a teacher outside of TAMS. These
experiences indicate that I have a good understanding of the communication it takes to
run GVS and how to help students in all roles.
3. How would you ensure the committee stays active the whole year? What problems could
you foresee, and how would you resolve them?
Sign-ups for teaching and grading generally take place in the beginning of each semester,
with each teaching session spanning 11-12 weeks. As a result, it will be easy to ensure
that there are consistent opporutnities for students throughout the year. However, a
possible problem that may arise could be the closing down of a classroom, which
happened a lot after the first semester. To address this problem, I would contact Asma,
the head coordinator, and find new classrooms and opportunities to work with existing
teachers outside of TAMS. This will allow students to maintain volunteering even with
location changes.
4. List the other commitments you plan on having during your senior year. (Research, senior
mentoring, clubs, volunteering, etc.)
Next school year, I will be the Tutoring Coordinator for TAS and the Director of
Outreach for Driving Tomorrow. Additionally, I hope to continue my Data Science
research next year, which will require about 5-7 hours of my time per week. I have also
applied to be a senior mentor, which might be a responsibility of mine next year. Finally,
I plan on continuing to volunteer with Intellichoice and GVS in come capacity.
5. Create a timeline/outline for your plans for the year for one of your top 3 committees

Optional Questions (but highly recommended):
7. If you had the privilege to take one of the HOPE executives (Jay, Rishi, Crystelle,
Vineeth, Phoebe) on a date, who would you take and why? Please include details about
what the date would encompass.
I would take Rishi on a date because I know him the best and he is a very chill, intelligent, and
dedicated guy. I would start the night off by going to a trampoline park because Rishi seems like
the type of guy who would love to do backflips on a trampoline and play dodgeball. However, I
would make sure he doesn’t trip or anything so he doesn’t end up with another broken toe. Then,
after we are all tired out, I would take him to a chill restaurant to eat pizza or something because
Rishi is a casual guy and doesn’t care too much about fancy dinners. Then we would end the
night with a walk in the park to digest our food.
